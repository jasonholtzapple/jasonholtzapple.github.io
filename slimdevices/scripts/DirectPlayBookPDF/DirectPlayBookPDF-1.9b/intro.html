<h3>DirectPlayBookPDF</h3>
<p>Similar to DirectPlayBook but outputs your music catalog in PDF format one page per album, including cover art, album title, track listings, and an index at the end. It also creates a barcode on each page for that album and everything by that artist. A second script interfaces a barcode scanner to slimserver. The end result is the ability to create a physical catalog of one's music, that you can flip thru, pick an album, scan the album or artist barcode and have that play on a squeezebox. This allows for all the advantages of slimserver, while retaining the tactile experience of browsing your albums.

To use, read the README file included.  The script should work with a mysql database. It is untested with a stock SQLite db. It has been run on  server version 6.2, 6.3, and 6.5. It requires that several perl modules and third party apps be installed defined in the README.
